# Fibonacci Matrix Generator

This is an interesting implementation that generates a matrix where each element is a Fibonacci number (modulo 9) based on its position.

## Features

- Generates a matrix of any size
- Each element is calculated using the Fibonacci sequence
- Uses modulo 9 operation to keep numbers within 0-8 range
- Implements functional programming patterns
- Uses modern JavaScript features

## Code Structure

The code consists of two main functions:

1. `evolve`: A recursive function that calculates Fibonacci numbers
2. `generateMatrix`: Creates a matrix where each element is a Fibonacci number (mod 9)

## Usage

```javascript
const matrix = generateMatrix(6);
console.log(matrix);
```

## Implementation Details

The code uses:
- Arrow functions
- Array.from() for array creation
- Recursion
- Default parameters
- Functional programming patterns

## Pattern Recognition

This implementation demonstrates several interesting patterns:
- Mathematical patterns (Fibonacci sequence, matrix operations)
- Code structure patterns (functional programming, recursion)
- Problem-solving patterns (composition of simple functions)
